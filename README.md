# geoPool-game
An interactive Java billiards game for Geometry students. Users learn the Distance Formula to find the distance between a colored billiard ball and a cue ball. Then, in Round 2, they again calculate this distance, but they have to determine the time it will take for the ball to enter a nearby pocket.
